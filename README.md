# Calculator Test Automation

This project automates testing for the `Calculator` library using **JUnit 5**. It covers basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions like powers and trigonometric operations.

**Note**: The `calculator-1.0.jar` file is included in this repository for simplicity and ease of practice. While it's generally not recommended to include JAR files in a Git repository, it has been added here for the purpose of completing this task.
